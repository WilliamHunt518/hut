# DJI Hut Controller 
### University of Southampton 
------
The DJI Hut Controller is an Android mobile app designed to allow a drone operator to monitor and control a drone that is flying autonomously or under manual control. In autonomous mode, the drone receives commands from a server (see the [server repository][1]), and carries them out without required any input from the operator. The drone can be swapped to manual control, in which case the operator has complete control over the drone and any incoming commands from the server are ignored. 

The documentation for this repository can be found [here][2].
