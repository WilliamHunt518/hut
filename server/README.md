### University of Southampton 
------
The DJI Hut Server is a client-server application that is used for coordinating a fleet of drones. The organisation and planning is handled by a browser application, and the commands are relayed through to the drones through a mobile aplication (see the [Android app repository][1]). 

The documentation for this repository can be found [here][2].
